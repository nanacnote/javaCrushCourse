# javaCrushCourse

## week 1
In this laboratory exercise, we will investigate the use of the IntelliJ IDEA (IDE) to create a simple Java
application that prints a recipe for chocolate chip cookies on the screen:
Recipe : Chocolate chip cookies (makes 12 cookies)
Ingredients: 4oz sugar
4oz butter
8oz self raising flour
1 egg
vanilla essence
4oz chocolate chips
step 1 : Mix sugar, butter and self raising flour thoroughly
step 2 : Stir in egg, a few drops of vanilla essence and chocolate chips.
step 3 : Roll out mixture and cut out cookies.
step 4 : Bake in hot oven (Gas Mark 6) for 10-12 minutes.
In order to do this you will need to:
1. Create a .java file to contains the Java code which will produce this output.
2. Compile the code.
3. Run the application to test the output.

While you can write the source code (the .java file) using any text editor and compile and run the program using
command line tools, you may find it easier to use an IDE such as IntelliJ, which not only allows you to edit the
code, but also to compile and run the application. It has an easy to use interface, with syntax highlighting, code
completion, code templates and editor hints to help avoid mistakes.
